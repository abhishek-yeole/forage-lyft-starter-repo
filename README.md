# Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
This project forms part of the Back-End Engineering virtual internship program offered by Forage in collaboration with Lyft.
## Overview of the Virtual Internship Program
The Back-End Engineering virtual internship program aims to provide practical skills and hands-on experience in diverse aspects of software development. The program encompasses four main tasks, each focusing on a specific area of expertise.

### 1. Software Architecture
In this task, the objective was to devise a well-structured and efficient architecture for a previously disorganized component. By utilizing UML (Unified Modeling Language) techniques, I evaluated the existing system and proposed a clean architecture that enhances maintainability and scalability.

### 2. Code Refactoring
The second task involved restructuring a disordered Python system. By implementing design principles and industry best practices, I reorganized the codebase to enhance readability, modularity, and overall code quality. The refactoring process aimed to boost performance and streamline future enhancements.

### 3. Unit Testing
To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the refactored system, I developed comprehensive unit tests. By covering critical functionality and edge cases, these tests validate the behavior of individual components and help identify and rectify any regressions or bugs introduced during refactoring.

### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
The final task focused on implementing new features using the Test-Driven Development approach. Following TDD principles, I initially created tests for the desired functionality and then incrementally developed the code to pass the tests. This methodology ensures thorough testing and alignment with project requirements.

Please feel free to explore the repository, review the code, and access relevant documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you Forage-Lyft for this amazing Experience!
